Hi, i`m Ann Bekker!
Now i`m medical student, but hope for good luck in DE
I can program in turbo pascale, but i don`t think i can use it anywhere
Also i`m interested in this speciality and i will try hard, so i won`t quit halfway
First task was difficult for me, because i know nothing about DE before, i hope for help from teammates (if i can say so) and teachers
Also hope for interesting tasks and explanation as simple as about git
What about my hobbies? I think the main is reading manga/manhwa, read books (the last book about maniac was very interesting), maybe sport (do some exercies, ya know)
It was small piece of my life, thanks for reading!

Now i add some smal details about me. It will be about my gob.
Can i call that my job? Not yet. 
But i`m nurse in hospital. I help to curse patients with cardiovascular pathology.
